# Skeleton

Skeleton is an _opinionated_ starter kit for building Laravel applications with
**Inertia**, **Vue**, and **Tailwind CSS**. I don't expect this be useful to
everyone, as it maps closely to my personal preferences, but I hope it can
serve as a good starting point for some.

## Creating a new project

To create a new project using this skeleton, run the following command:

```bash
laravel new --using nhedger/skeleton my-project
```
